        <h1>SOLID Principle</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD)
          principles by Robert C. Martin. The main purpose of introducing the
          concept of SOLID prinicple is to solve the issue of tight coupling
          during the development process. It is like standard which provides
          basis for code reusability, extensibility and easy code
          maintainability. The acronym SOLID stands for

            <summary>
              The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should
              have only one job to accomplish. And a class mustn't have more
              than one reason to change.
            </summary>
            <pre>
            It makes the software easier to implement andprevent unexpected
             side effects of future change. If there would not
            have been single responsibility the principle then the job of
            developer might become the messy job coz if single class solves
            multiple responsibilities and the software needs to get updated in
            the future then it becomes so complex to update the codebase due to
            multiple responsibilities for a single class. Lets take the example
            to see the difference between code following Single Responsibility
            Principle and the code not following Single Responsibility
            Principle. At first have a look at example that doesnot follows
            Single Responsibility Principle and we will solve the issue
            afterwards using Single Responsibilty Prinicple.

              The above code snippets show a class performing multiple
              responsibilities as the class HttpClient is performing two
              different operations,
            </summary>
            <pre>
            one is fetching the data from the server and returning
           response and the same class is also handling the error which
           violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Let's see another
           example where there are two different classes to perform the
           HttpClient operation and to handle all the possible errors or
           warnings.

                    or deleting the data from the server and the class ErrorHandler

                In fig.1 the simple calculator performs only two operation, they are addition and subtraction.
                If user initial requirement is for only those two operation then the developer can provide solution 
                to the user with these operation and the system get build and launched for initial phase. Once the system 
                gets launched then we are not allowed to modify those operations but we can add other new operations like 
                multiplication, divison and so on with out disturbing the old fucntion which are already in the subject as Showing
                in fig.2 .

            3. Liskov Substitution Principle
          </h1>
          <details>
            <summary>
                The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of
                its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses
                to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass. 
            </summary>
            <pre>
               
                An overridden method of a subclass needs to accept the same input parameter
                values as the method of the superclass. That means you can implement less 
                restrictive validation rules, but you are not allowed to enforce stricter ones
                in your subclass. Otherwise, any code that calls this method on an object of the
                superclass might cause an exception, if it gets called with an object of the subclass.
                Let's take an example to make the concept little bit more clear.

                Instead of creating a general interface to solve various problems, create 
                Many different small interfaces, that can solve a specific problem which makes the code more reusable and
                more extensible. As we know every method or function inside interface needs to be implemented inside 
                the child class which implements that interface and some methods might be useful and some
                are not which increases the code redundant as the same piece of code are repeated again and again which are of
                no use.
